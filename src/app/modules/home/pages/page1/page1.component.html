    The multi-source search component is an intelligent system that allows users to search across multiple types of data sources (text files, Excel files, relational databases, knowledge graphs, etc.) using natural language queries. The main goal of this component is to simplify interaction with various sources of information by eliminating the need to master complex query syntaxes, such as SQL, or to understand the underlying data structure.
